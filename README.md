# juxta-proxy-server

I built a fantasy football tool using AngularJS
(check it out: https://m-tambo.github.io/juxta-position)

But I was having trouble with my API calls, due to cross-origin restrictions.

So I built this little proxy server in Node.js to handle the calls for me.

In the process, I added a few NPM packages to my tool belt

## cors
https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors
This simply enables CORS for whatever routes you define.

## request-promise
https://www.npmjs.com/package/request-promise
Just what it sounds like... an HTTP request with a promise built-in. I wait until the data is received and then passit back to the client.
